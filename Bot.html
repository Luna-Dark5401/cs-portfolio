    <h1>Vindinium and Bot Game</h1>

    <h2>What is Vindinium?</h2>
    <p>
        Vindinium is a website that usually uses the practices of javascript.The website is created so then you create a bot and put any javascript to make 
        it play and move around the areana of the game.<br>Vindinium is played by having an AI coding content so the bot you have entered inside will be
        following the orders you have given it.The once you believe that the code or oders you have written down for your bot then to win the game you must 
        be able to collect the most gold than the other bots inside the game.
        This game is continuous and can be played over and over again.

    <h2>What the code above mean:</h2>
    <p>
        The code above may be a bit confusing at the fist look but it actually is a bit simple once it is broken down into parts.The code above is just the actions
        that I wish my bot will be taking.The begining of the code is really simple actually.It is just the variables that will be use when the bot comes
        to <strong>LIFE</strong>.The line that states THIS IS GLOBAL DATA is where we actually create the function for the bot to take action on the
        Vindinium page.The variable "var enemyBots" is to help my bot to attack the other bot on the page and the code "var enemyattack = enemyBots"
        finds the nearest enemy near me and will attack the enemy and the result depends on both of our codes.There is another aspect of the code, there has to be 
        if/elses statements because there might be a problem if you are engaged with an enemy and you are losing life point so then you can command your
        bot to do another action if that would happen and the bot will avoid enemies,if it can, to restore on Hp.
        In the last set of the coding it is basically just ordering the bot to move around freely if a particular destination is out of reach.After most
        of the coding,it is a code to complete all of our functions and transfer it to the vindinium bot that I have,which would then make it follow the 
        code that is written down.
        </p>
    <h2>What was learned</h2>
    <p>
        I learned a lot actually in this project.I had leaerned about javascript in general and learned that it holds information in every click or page.
        I had also learned that certain codes can create action that things like a bot will follow.There was also a complication in learning the code pieces
        but I was able to learn most of it and it was quite an interesting piece to the coding experience.
