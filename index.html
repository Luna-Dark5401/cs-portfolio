       <div id="More"> Most of these hobbies and interest come from my friends and my brother.They are a big part of my life.
        They are wierd and I really accept that type of wierdness.I am wierd too.
        Being wierd and strange is what I do.I really like to read and listen to music.
        Reading to me helps me go to another world and make my imagination expand.
        Music makes all the noise in my house quiet and make me feel calm and less angry at times.
        I also have a love for zodiac signs.I am a Taurus,born on May 4(Star Wars Day).
        Computer Science is something I believe that alot of people should try.Its fun to create websites and other things with 
        the more experiences in the future.
