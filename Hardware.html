                The motherboard is the main system in which your computer runs on.The mother board is an essantial part of the computer system its the 
                head of the system. The motherboard serves as the main system where the memory,and CPU is held in,as well as input and output devices.
                The motherboard is the system that connects everything together.</td>

                CPU,or the Central Proccessing Unit,is the "brain of the computer".Every command given must be processed by the CPU.Instructions from
                other computer programs go through the CPU and the CPU is then processing it to the motherboard. The CPU is essential for the computer
                because if it wasn't there then the entire system would crash, the CPU is essential as well as the other systems.

                RAM,or Random Access Memory,is like short term memory,it doesn't store information permantely.RAM is used in most computers. 
                Its a storage space for data and it helps the CPU store some of the programs that are there ready for your computer.
                It turns off when the computer turns off.It will just stay running if the computer is off.
